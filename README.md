## What can I do?

With Easy Binder you can add the files downloaded to your smartphone to the
app, defining subjects, teachers, type of file (notes, old tests, etc) and some
other tags to organize them. 

## Why would I use Easy Binder?

We all know how hard it is, sometimes, to keep our studying up to date.
Sometimes, its even harder if we cannot organize properly. Easy Binder will
be useful to make the organization less painful, and, doing so, improving you
chances of doing great.

## How can Easy Binder be useful to the university administrative managment?

Well, it's quite simply. When we help students organize themselves and graduate
we minimize the ammount of work done by the managers. If there are fewer students,
there are more spots in classes, less money spent in food, water, energy, acomodations
and human resources. 

### Can I see the project?

Sure. For now, we have this [mockup](https://marvelapp.com/cbhjedh/screen/60637104), made in Marvel App, ready. Test it.
