# Virtual Binder

Virtual Binder is an easy way to organize your studying materials, making it
easy to study more efficiently.

## What can I do?

With Virtual Binder you can add the files downloaded to your cellphone to the
app, defining subjects, teachers, type of file (notes, old tests, etc) and some
other tags to organize them. 

## Why would I use Virtual Binder?

We all know how hard it is, sometimes, to keep our studying up to date.
Sometimes, its even harder if we cannot organize properly. Virtual Binder will
be useful to make the organization less painful, and, doing so, improving you
chances of doing great.
